## Multi-variable linear regression
There can be multiple variables on the x-axis that affects actual y value.
For this case we need matrix.

For each x values of given data we need weights that related to it.
Thus, if x matrix is 5X3 weights matrix has to be 3X1(or higher but number of rows of weight matrix got to be equal as the number of columns for matrix x). 

Compare between `multi_linear_regression_mat.py` and `multi_linear_regression_nomat.py` to see how matrix supports.

If you are not sure please check linear algebra.
